This theme offers:

-   Beautiful colors that blend nicely
-   Neutral background following the material guidelines,
-   Non-Bluish background to improve sleep by decreasing blue-light exposure
-   The colors are chosen so the code stands out from the rest of the UI element
-   Provides good amount of contrast following accesibility guidelines without being too high contrast

This theme takes inspiration from Night Owl, the material guidelines and the Dark+ default theme
